# Emily's Portfolio

In 2021 I built a static web portfolio for my sister,she studied graphic design and wanted to showcase her work.

## About

I built this static page when I was 16 years old, I used to don't share my code at all, now I wanna create a collection with old projects and share them with the community as a way to show my progress and how I've evolved as a developer.

## Deployment
